#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
This project is a simple web-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes two numeric inputs from the user and performs the selected operation. It also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Features:
- Allows the user to input two numbers.
- Supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Displays the result of the operation.
- Handles errors like division by zero.

### How It Works:
1. The user enters two numbers into the input fields.
2. The user selects an arithmetic operation by clicking one of the operation buttons (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. The result of the operation is displayed below the input fields.
4. The app checks for division by zero and invalid inputs, providing error messages as necessary.
